# life-in-the-moods
A Vanilla++++ like modpack centered on exploration and decoration.

A Vanilla++++ like modpack centered on adventure, exploration and decoration with just enough tech (Ancient Warfare 2, Immersive engineering and Progressive Automation) to loose the need to struggle to survive.


It's very close to "Life in the Woods: Renaissance" by Phedran, but with my own twist in it, and without the shady launcher and the dubious respect for the licences.


The name is a porte-manteau from the Glenn Miller track "In the Mood" and the modpack's name "Life in the Woods".


A resource pack will be soon released to adjust the global mood ( ;) ) by changing musics, few textures and such.

 

If your computer pack enough oomph, you can give a shot to Optifine and the marvelous Shader mod with any shader your taste go to, I personally use SEUS v10.2 preview 1 ULTRA you can easily find them on the shader mod site ! Simply put Optifine and the shader mod in your "mods" directory and the shader's zip in the "shaderpacks" folder.
